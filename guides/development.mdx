title: Development Setup
description: Set up your development environment, run the example project, run tests, and contribute to Django Admin Tabs
---

## Getting Started with Development

Django Admin Tabs uses Docker for development to ensure a consistent environment across all contributors.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Make (optional, but recommended)

## Setting Up the Development Environment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:mehmetakyuz/django-admin-tabs.git
    cd django-admin-tabs
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the development environment">
    ```bash
    make dev
    ```

    This command will:
    - Build the Docker container
    - Install all dependencies
    - Start the Django development server
    - Make the example project available at http://localhost:8000
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access the example project">
    Once the containers are running, visit http://localhost:8000/admin in your browser to see the example polls application with tabbed admin.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The `make dev` command uses Docker Compose to set up the entire environment. You don't need to manually install Python, Django, or any dependencies.
</Note>

## Running the Example Project

The example project is a complete Django application demonstrating Django Admin Tabs with a Poll/Choice/Answer voting system.

### Creating a Superuser

To log into the admin interface, you'll need a superuser account:

```bash
make superuser
```

Follow the prompts to create your admin account.

### Example Project Structure

```
example/
├── __init__.py
├── settings.py       # Django settings with django_admin_tabs installed
├── urls.py           # URL configuration
├── wsgi.py          # WSGI application
└── polls/           # Example app
    ├── models.py    # Poll, Choice, and Answer models
    └── admin.py     # Tabbed admin configuration
```

### Key Features to Explore

<Tip>
  After creating a superuser and logging in, try these features:
  
  1. Create a new Poll with the question field
  2. Add Choices using the inline form on the Poll tab
  3. Switch to the Answers tab to see the nested changelist
  4. Add Answers and notice how the choice dropdown only shows choices from the current poll
</Tip>

## Running Tests

The test suite ensures Django Admin Tabs works correctly across different Django versions.

### Run All Tests

```bash
make test
```

This command runs the full test suite inside the Docker container:

```bash
docker exec -it django-admin-tabs python manage.py test django_admin_tabs
```

### Manual Testing

For manual testing and debugging:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the container shell">
    ```bash
    make shell
    ```
    This opens a Django shell inside the running container.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run specific tests">
    ```bash
    docker exec -it django-admin-tabs python manage.py test django_admin_tabs.tests.specific_test
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a branch">
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make your changes">
    Edit files in the `django_admin_tabs/` directory. The development server will automatically reload when you save files.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run pre-commit hooks">
    ```bash
    make pre-commit
    ```
    
    This runs code formatting and linting checks using the configured pre-commit hooks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your changes">
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Code Quality Tools

The project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks are configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and run automatically before each commit. They include:

- **Ruff**: Fast Python linter and formatter
- **Trailing whitespace removal**
- **End-of-file fixes**
- **YAML validation**

Install pre-commit hooks locally:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Ruff Configuration

Ruff is used for both linting and formatting. Configuration is in `pyproject.toml`.

## Contributing Guidelines

### Before Submitting a PR

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure tests pass">
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
    All tests must pass before submitting a pull request.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run pre-commit hooks">
    ```bash
    make pre-commit
    ```
    Code must pass all linting and formatting checks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test with the example project">
    Verify your changes work correctly with the example polls application:
    ```bash
    make dev
    # Visit http://localhost:8000/admin and test manually
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update documentation">
    If you've added features or changed behavior, update the relevant documentation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
3. **Make your changes** with clear, descriptive commits
4. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request
5. **Respond to review feedback** from maintainers

<Tip>
  Write clear commit messages that explain what changed and why. Good commit messages help reviewers understand your changes and make the project history more useful.
