</Note>

## Installation Requirements

After installing django-admin-tabs, add it to your Django project's `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    
    # Add django_admin_tabs
    "django_admin_tabs",
    
    # Your apps
    "myapp",
]
```

<Tip>
  Django Admin Tabs comes with built-in templates and CSS static files. No additional configuration is needed after adding it to `INSTALLED_APPS`.
</Tip>

## Third-Party Library Compatibility

### django-object-actions

Django Admin Tabs is **fully compatible** with [django-object-actions](https://pypi.org/project/django-object-actions/), which adds object-level and model-level actions to the Django admin.

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django_object_actions import DjangoObjectActions
from django_admin_tabs import AdminTab, TabbedModelAdmin

class MyModelAdminStep(AdminTab, DjangoObjectActions, admin.ModelAdmin):
    admin_tab_name = "Details"
    change_actions = ("custom_action",)
    
    def custom_action(self, request, obj):
        # Your custom action logic
        pass

class MyModelAdmin(TabbedModelAdmin, admin.ModelAdmin):
    admin_tabs = [MyModelAdminStep]
```

<Note>
  When combining multiple mixins, place them in this order: `AdminTab` or `AdminChangeListTab`, then third-party mixins, then `admin.ModelAdmin`.
</Note>

### Other Admin Extensions

Django Admin Tabs should work with most Django admin extensions that:
- Use standard Django admin mixins
- Don't heavily modify the admin templates
- Don't conflict with the tabbed navigation structure

If you encounter compatibility issues with other libraries, please [report them on GitHub](https://github.com/mehmetakyuz/django-admin-tabs/issues).

## Known Limitations

### Delete Button on Nested Changelists

The delete button does not work for individual objects in nested changelists and is therefore hidden.

<Warning>
  The delete button is hidden on nested changelist detail pages. However, you can still delete objects using the changelist bulk action "Delete selected items".
</Warning>

**Workaround:**

To delete objects from nested changelists:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the nested changelist tab">
    Go to the parent object's admin page and click on the nested changelist tab.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select objects to delete">
    Check the boxes next to the objects you want to delete.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use the bulk delete action">
    Select "Delete selected items" from the action dropdown and click "Go".
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Why This Limitation Exists

The delete button limitation exists because:
- Nested changelists use a different URL structure than regular admin pages
- The delete confirmation page expects a standard admin URL pattern
- Maintaining the proper redirect chain after deletion is complex in nested contexts

<Tip>
  This limitation only affects the delete button on individual object pages. All other admin functionality, including list filters, search, and bulk actions, works as expected.
</Tip>

## Browser Compatibility

Django Admin Tabs uses standard CSS (no JavaScript) and is compatible with all modern browsers that Django admin supports:

- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Opera (latest)

## Database Compatibility

Django Admin Tabs works with any database backend supported by Django:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL/MariaDB
- SQLite
- Oracle

No database-specific features are used, ensuring broad compatibility.
