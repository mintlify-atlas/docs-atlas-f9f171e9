## What is Django Admin Tabs?

Django Admin Tabs extends Django's built-in admin interface to support tabbed navigation and nested changelists. Instead of displaying all fields and related objects on a single page, you can organize them into logical tabs that load independently.

Each tab is rendered at a separate URL and saves independently from other tabs. This approach provides better organization for complex models without requiring custom JavaScript or frontend frameworks.

## Use Cases

Django Admin Tabs is perfect for:

- **Complex models with many fields**: Split large forms into logical sections across multiple tabs
- **Parent-child relationships**: Display related objects in nested changelists filtered by the parent
- **Multi-step workflows**: Guide users through data entry in a structured, step-by-step manner
- **Organized admin interfaces**: Keep your admin clean and focused by separating concerns across tabs

## How It Works

Django Admin Tabs provides three main components:

1. **`AdminTab`** - A standard Django `ModelAdmin` that can be used as a tab in a tabbed interface
2. **`AdminChangeListTab`** - A specialized admin class that renders a changelist filtered by a parent object
3. **`TabbedModelAdmin`** - The main admin class that orchestrates tabs and handles navigation

<Tip>
All tab classes work as regular Django admin classes, so you can use standard Django admin features like `fields`, `inlines`, `list_display`, `list_filter`, and more.
</Tip>

## Example Preview

Here's a quick preview of what you can build with Django Admin Tabs:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django_admin_tabs import AdminTab, AdminChangeListTab, TabbedModelAdmin

class PollAdminStep(AdminTab, admin.ModelAdmin):
    admin_tab_name = "Poll"
    fields = ("question",)
    inlines = (ChoiceInline,)

class AnswerAdmin(AdminChangeListTab, admin.ModelAdmin):
    admin_tab_name = "Answers"
    model = Answer
    fk_field = "choice__poll"
    parent_model = Poll
    list_display = ("timestamp", "choice")

@admin.register(Poll)
class PollAdmin(TabbedModelAdmin, admin.ModelAdmin):
    admin_tabs = [
        PollAdminStep,
        AnswerAdmin,
    ]
```

This creates a Poll admin with two tabs: one for editing the poll itself, and another showing all answers related to that poll.

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Django**: 3.2 or higher
